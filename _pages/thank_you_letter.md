Dear Myself in 2026,

Thank you for taking the time to plan for my future. Thank you for thinking about potential future paths and how to get there. Without that planning, I would have been stumbling. Or I might have wound up doing something I didn't think about, and so might end up not enjoying. 

Since 2026 me is also writing this, I don't know how it will all turn out, but I am already feel like I have a much clearer path forwards than I did before I started this planning. So thank you.
