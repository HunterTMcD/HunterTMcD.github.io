My  name is Hunter McDonald. I'm a 4th year Math and Physics major at the University of Colorado at Boulder. I'm also minoring in Philosophy and Computer Science. The point of this website is to host information about myself, including my career goals, my CV, and any personal or professional projects. 

My current career goal is to become a math and/or science teacher at high school or college level. I am planning on pursuing a math masters degree after I graduate from CU and then becoming a teacher.
